Welcome to the DIY Grow Box guide
This guide is made for those who would like to build a grow box for indoor cultivation and are not afraid of a little Do-It-Yourself. We will be building our own grow box from scratch. The information presented here was gathered from various forums and articles, combined with the feedback from the growing community and hopefully from you too. 


Goals
Find a suitable discreet grow space
Build an efficient LED light
Ventilation with active carbon filtering
Limit plant height
Automatic irrigation system
Prepare ideal grow medium


Setup summary
14 x LED strips, 1560 LEDs total
2 x 185W - 700mA Constant Current drivers
5” / 125 x 300mm carbon filter, 500 m3/h
5” twin speed inline fan, 220/360 m3/h
High pressure aeroponics tote
Double door wardrobe (86x52x185 cm / 33x21x72 inch)

Why did I write this guide
This is my way of celebrating that Canada legalized recreational use and home cultivation of cannabis. Canadian residents can grow four plants up to a height of 100 cm in their homes.  I believe many people would like to give home growing a try, and I would like to provide them a starting point by building an example grow environment.
