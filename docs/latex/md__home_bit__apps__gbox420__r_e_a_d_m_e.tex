 We build an Arduino based grow box monitoring and controlling system out of an old PC case with a power supply. The A\+Tmega2560 microcontroller running the Gbox420 sketch is connected to an E\+S\+P8266 wifi chip with a custom E\+S\+P-\/\+Link firmware and reports sensor readings through Pushing\+Box message A\+PI to Google Sheets. The E\+S\+P8266 wifi chip will act as an internet gateway and a web server at the same time, hosting a mobile friendly control and monitoring interface for the grow box.

Website hosted by the E\+SP link, displaying sensor readings from Arduino and controlling the grow box 

Inside the PC case\+: Arduino, power meter, led driver and dimming circuit, 8 relays for controlling lights/fans and pumps 

External light, humidity and temperature sensors connected over U\+TP cable 

Arduino controlling the L\+ED C\+OB lights 

The grow box that is going to receive the automation upgrade 

Google Sheets integrated into the grow box interface\+:
